    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Halleluia Zeyohannes, a senior at UMass Lowell studying
             Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy playing Pokémon games, 
             reading books, learning new languages, and trying out new food. When I 
             get the opprotunity, I love to travel as well.
        </p>

                    didn't meet my expectations; I read the book because so 
                    many people loved it but it didn't live up to the hype for

                      the power system, the progession of the book is somewhat 
                      slow which can make it hard to read, but I'm looking

                     English versions. While the plot is decent, the 
                     characterizations in the series really make it lovable and 
                     hilarious. The premise makes for a blend of comedy and 
                     family good feels that you just can't <i>not</i> enjoy.

    <h2>Learning about the World</h2>
        <p>Due to COVID, I haven't been able to travel as much as I want to.
             However, I was lucky to be able to go on three different trips
             just before the pandemic, in 2019. As I mentioned, I love learning 
             languages and these experiences allowed me to put my practice to 
             the test in the most challenging way- with native speakers!

        <h3>Spain</h3>
            <p>During the 2018-2019 school year, I got chosen along with several
                classmates to be a part of the Spanish Exchange Program. In March
                2019, we went to Collado Villalba, Spain for two weeks, where the 
                exchange school was and our Spaniard partners lived. We got to 
                travel to other cities of Spain as well, such as Toledo, Granada, 
                Segoiva, and Madrid, the country's capital. The two weeks were spent
                learning about Spain's history and culture, especially putting the 
                Spanish we learned in class to the test. It was truly one of the 
                most memorable times of my life and an irreplaceable experience. 
                This blog is where the other American students and I shared 
                our experience:

                After our trip to Spain, a friend made a video slideshow of images and
                videos we all took in Spain and while the Spaniards visted us in America.
                Since it was posted on YouTube, I found the iframe element on the W3 Schools
                site that allowed me to post the YouTube video directly on the page.

        <h3>Ethiopia</h3>
            <p>
                In the summer of 2019, I went to Ethiopia for the second time in my life.
                My family is from there so the purpose of the trip was to visit family that 
                my parents hadn't seen in a long time. We mainly stayed in the capital 
                Addis Ababa where most of my family resides. I even got to meet some family 
                that lives in France because they were visiting at the same time! 
                My paternal grandmother and some other patenal relatives live in Axum, a 
                city in the northern Tigray region so we visited them and saw the 
                <i>hawelti</i>, or obelisks.

        <h3>China</h3>
           <p>
               Lastly, I went to China right after the end of the Fall 2019 semester. 
               I went with several other UML students and we mostly stayed in Beijing. However,
               we got to travel a bit and saw part of the Great Wall of China, which 
               was super exciting because it had always been something that seemed 
               unreachable to me as a kid. I also witnessed a traditional tea ceremony 
               and got to experience the life of a student at a language university 
               in Beijing. During my time here I made a few Chinese friends that also 
               taught me some basic Mandarin which was awesome! I also got to try duck 
               for the very first time as well as kung pao chicken and baozi(my favorite).
