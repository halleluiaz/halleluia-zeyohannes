I use this file to style my webpage. I set the background color and format 
different elements on the page by linking this to index.html.

    Formatting the body elements sets the scene for the rest of the webpage's look.
    Here, I take care of what will apply to the whole page, and in this case, 
    the color and text font of the site.

   I use the h1 element to display the name of the webpage so this formatting 
   makes it front and center with the largest font size and center alignment.

    Since h2 elements are used for splitting up the page's information into

   Once again, I use the h3 element to divide my content into subtopics and use the

    for the p, figcaption, ul, and li elements, the default font sizes were too small 
    to be easily read so I used the next few rules to take care of this. Additionally,
    I wanted to center my figures so that there wouldn't be too much empty space on the 
    right side of them.

   Since I used a paragragh element for the copyright aknowledgement at the bottom of the 
   page, I wanted to make sure that the text for it wasn't the same size as other text 
   on the page. Using the id attribute with that specifc element allows me to make this

   When validating index.html one of the errors that came up was that the attribute frameborder
   is now obselete for the iframe element in HTML5. The fix was to use css, and this class allows me to

   To increase readability, I chose to add a hover color to highlight
